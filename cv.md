### Code Example
In this task, two strings of the form "03 November 2017 04:17" are passed to our test DateTime function.
You need to turn the strings into dates, compare them. For the one that is bigger, get the day of the week and return it from the function.  


``` 
function testDateTime(a, b) {
    let days = ['Воскресенье', 'Понедельник', 'Вторник', 'Среда', 'Четверг', 'Пятница', 'Суббота']
    let f = new Date(a);
    let s = new Date(b);
    if (f > s){
        let d = f.getDay();
        return days[d];
    }
    else if (s > f){
        let d = s.getDay();
        return days[d];
    }
    else {
        let d = s.getDay();
        return days[d];
    }
}
